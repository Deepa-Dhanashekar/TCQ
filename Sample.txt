	Important points to be noted:
		 No batch swapping will be accepted as batch sizes have to be normalized.
		 Trainings will be organized at your base locations to avoid any travel.
		 Training schedules will not be changed whatsoever. Hence please plan your professional and personal commitments appropriately.
		 There will be NO back up classes / NO schedule swapping in case you miss any of your planned calendar trainings.
		 Classroom trainings will not be converted to hybrid mode, hence your presence is mandated.
